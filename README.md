# Old-fashioned Arcade

## 개발 배경
In these days, as many new entertainment facilities have been created, the arcade we used to enjoy all days with a few coins as children has been disappeared.
<br>
We felt very sad to this situation, so we developed this game so that anyone can enjoy the game in personal computer that we enjoyed in the arcade when we were young.
<br>
The old-fashioned games usually have a monotonous background or objects design. So we drew a background and planes that could remind us high tech facilities in modern times.

## Overview

This game is a strategic shooting game to destroy dangerous facilities on the sea.
<br>
A pilot was dispatched to destroy the facilities.
He must avoid numerous missiles and enemies to approach and blow up the facilities.
<br>
When the game starts, the player can choose one plane to control between two fighter planes. 
Once the plane is determined by clicking the left mouse button, the game begins, and missiles and enemies fly toward the player.
<br>
At first, there are few missiles and enemies on the screen, but as time goes by, the number of missiles and enemies increases.
To clear the mission, you must avoid all missiles and enemies and reach the target point.
<br>
You can control the player's plane through the directional keys of the keyboard, and if you collide with missiles or enemies, you lose and the game ends.
<br>
In addition, heart-shaped supplies periodically come out from above and when the fighter touches them, the player's speed of movement increases.
